# SHO_rota


First iteration was makeCSV.R. This takes the basic excel rota file the SHOs get sent and just reformats it into a shape that the next script will understand. The output from this script is used by convert_csv_to_ics.py

This worked ok but was annoying as I couldn't figure out how to get it fully automated. The python conversion library used a popup that you had to click on to convert each file which was a pain. But it worked so I could get some user feedback from the calendar files. 

People told me they liked the idea and would use it. They also told me that having a ward calender automatically made too would help.
